# Song-Library

## Description
This project is an application created in Java and FXML. It is an app that saves, selects and displays songs from a user created library.
Users must first add a song for it to show up in the list viewer. Then, based on the selected object in the list, the user can edit the previously saved fields or delete the song.
The songs are saved in a text file that contains a list of all the song's name, artist, year and album.
